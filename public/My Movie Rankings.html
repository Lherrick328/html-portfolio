<h1>The Best Movies According to Lenny</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All-Time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>

<p>This is my all time favorite movie. It does an amazing job showing how brutal WWII actually was and had amzing acting.
</p>
<h3>The Raid 2</h3>

<p>This is my favorite martial arts movie. The fight scenes are choreographed to perfection, and were some of the best I have even seen in a film.</p>

<h3>Logan</h3>

<p>This is probably one of the best comic book movies ever. I loved Wolverine growing up and this movie really captured the raw emotion and grittiness surrounding Logan as a character.</p>
