<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I am a 36 year old personal trainer looking to switch to a career in Web Development. I am currently taking Angela Yu's 
  Web Development course through Udemy and have already learned so much. I am excited to get started in this career and to learn
 as much as I can to become a well rounded developer. Any and all advice for a beginner would be greatly appreciated.
